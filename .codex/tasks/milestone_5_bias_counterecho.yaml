ask: |
  Implement feature_spec at feature_specs/m5_bias_counterecho.md.
  Deliver:
  - Compute and store source diversity metrics per verification (domain spread, geo spread, media type).
  - Contrarian subagent: intentionally search for counterclaims and conflicting evidence; tag conflicts.
  - UI: diversity score, conflict badges, “See opposing evidence” panel.
  - Temporal drift flag: show when evidence is stale or superseded; suggest refresh.
  - Tests: diversity calculation, conflict tagging, drift triggering on stale dates.
inputs:
  - path: feature_specs/m5_bias_counterecho.md
outputs:
  - plan.md
  - HOW_TO_VERIFY.md
