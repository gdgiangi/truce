# Truce Code of Conduct

Truce exists to help people reason together ‚Äî across disagreement, culture, and background ‚Äî in search of shared understanding and truth.  
Our community blends engineers, researchers, designers, philosophers, and curious minds who believe that respectful inquiry and transparent evidence are foundations of progress.

This document outlines the standards we expect from everyone participating in the Truce ecosystem: contributors, maintainers, mentors, and users alike.  
It applies to all Truce spaces ‚Äî GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and any affiliated online or in-person events.

## üåç Our Core Principles

### **1. Seek truth, not victory.**
Disagreement is inevitable and welcome ‚Äî disrespect is not.  
Argue ideas, not identities. Challenge reasoning with evidence, not ego.  
Remember that Truce exists to make dialogue *safer and smarter*, not louder.

### **2. Be friendly, patient, and open-minded.**
People come to Truce with different skill levels, languages, and lived experiences.  
Give others the benefit of curiosity. Ask before assuming.  
Mentorship and kindness make our ideas stronger.

### **3. Be inclusive and respectful.**
We welcome contributors of all races, ethnicities, cultures, national origins, colors, immigration statuses, social and economic classes, education levels, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, ages, body types, family statuses, political beliefs, religions, and mental or physical abilities.  
No one should ever feel excluded, dismissed, or unsafe because of who they are.

### **4. Be clear and constructive.**
Precision matters ‚Äî in code, arguments, and conversation.  
Offer feedback with empathy and evidence. Avoid sarcasm, mockery, or vague criticism.  
If you spot an error, fix it or help others fix it.

### **5. Use your words carefully.**
We are a community of professionals and learners.  
Harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or exclusionary jokes will not be tolerated.  
This includes but is not limited to:
- Threats or violent language.
- Discriminatory or derogatory remarks.
- Posting sexually explicit or disturbing content.
- Doxing or sharing private information.
- Repeated unwelcome contact or attention.

If someone asks you to stop, stop immediately.

### **6. When we disagree, seek understanding.**
Truce thrives on thoughtful dissent.  
Ask clarifying questions. Listen actively.  
When two people interpret evidence differently, that‚Äôs an opportunity to learn ‚Äî not a failure to agree.  
We prefer collaboration over cancellation, correction over condemnation.

## üïäÔ∏è A Final Word

The Truce project is built on dialogue, not dogma.  
We expect everyone to contribute in ways that strengthen our shared pursuit of clarity, fairness, and truth.  
Mistakes happen ‚Äî what matters is how we respond.  
Empathy, rigor, and accountability are the values that keep our work human.
