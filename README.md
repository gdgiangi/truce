# truce
Truce is an open, neutral MVP that turns hot claims into transparent Claim Cards and a live consensus board. It links evidence and provenance, runs a multi-model assessment panel with citations, and maps agreement/division to surface common ground. Includes NVC de-escalation, JSON-LD exports, and reproducibility bundles.
