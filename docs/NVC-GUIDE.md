# Nonviolent Communication Guide

## Overview

Truce integrates Nonviolent Communication (NVC) principles to help users express themselves in ways that reduce conflict and increase understanding. This guide provides practical tools for de-escalating contentious discussions.

## Core NVC Components

### 1. Observation (not evaluation)
**State facts without interpretation**

❌ "Crime is out of control"  
✅ "The violent crime severity index increased 15% from 2021-2023"

❌ "Politicians ignore public safety"  
✅ "The current budget allocates X% to police services"

### 2. Feelings (not thoughts disguised as feelings)
**Express emotional responses**

❌ "I feel like the government doesn't care"  
✅ "I feel concerned about community safety"

❌ "That's ridiculous"  
✅ "I feel confused by this interpretation"

### 3. Needs (universal human values)
**Identify underlying needs**

- Safety and security
- Understanding and clarity
- Community and belonging
- Autonomy and choice
- Peace and harmony
- Justice and fairness

### 4. Requests (not demands)
**Ask for specific, doable actions**

❌ "You need to understand this"  
✅ "Would you be willing to look at this data with me?"

❌ "Stop being wrong"  
✅ "Could we explore where our interpretations differ?"

## Truce-Specific Applications

### Consensus Statement Writing

**Instead of:** "Anyone who thinks crime isn't rising is delusional"

**Try:** "I observe rising crime rates in recent data and feel concerned about community safety. I need reassurance that public safety is a priority. Would others be willing to discuss evidence-based safety measures?"

### Responding to Disagreement

**Instead of:** "That's completely wrong"

**Try:** "I see this differently based on [specific evidence]. I'm curious about your perspective. Could you share what information shapes your view?"

### Commenting on Evidence

**Instead of:** "This source is biased"

**Try:** "I notice this data comes from [source] and feel uncertain about its completeness. I need more diverse perspectives. Could we also look at data from [alternative source]?"

## De-escalation Templates

### When Someone Attacks Your Position

**Template:**
"I hear that you disagree with my interpretation. I feel [emotion] when I sense conflict around this topic. I need us to find common ground. Would you be willing to help me understand your perspective by sharing the evidence that informs your view?"

### When You Disagree Strongly

**Template:**
"I observe that we see this issue very differently. I feel [emotion] about [specific concern]. My need for [need] leads me to request that we examine [specific evidence] together. Would that work for you?"

### When Discussion Gets Heated

**Template:**
"I notice the energy in our conversation has intensified. I feel concerned that we might lose sight of our shared values. I need to find connection with you on this. Could we pause and identify what we both care about here?"

## Consensus Statement Guidelines

### Structure
1. **Observation**: What can we all see?
2. **Impact**: How does this affect people?
3. **Value**: What do we all care about?
4. **Path**: What could we explore together?

### Examples

**Good:**
"Police-reported crime statistics have limitations in capturing unreported incidents. This affects our understanding of actual crime levels. Most people value accurate information for decision-making. We could explore multiple data sources to get a fuller picture."

**Needs work:**
"Politicians lie about crime statistics to scare voters."

### Language Choices

**Softer language:**
- "I notice..." instead of "Obviously..."
- "It seems like..." instead of "It's clear that..."
- "I wonder if..." instead of "You should..."
- "Could it be that..." instead of "The fact is..."

**Inclusive language:**
- "We might consider..." instead of "You need to..."
- "What if we..." instead of "The solution is..."
- "I'm curious about..." instead of "Explain why..."

## Practical Exercises

### Observation Practice
Take this evaluative statement: "Crime is worse than ever"
Transform to observation: "The violent crime severity index reached [X] in 2024, the highest level since [year]"

### Needs Behind Positions
- Position: "We need more police"
- Possible needs: Safety, order, peace of mind, community well-being
- Alternative paths: Community programs, mental health services, economic development

### Request Clarity
- Vague: "Do something about this"
- Specific: "Would you be willing to look at the methodology section with me?"
- Doable: "Could we spend 5 minutes examining this chart together?"

## Integration with Truce Features

### Community Guidelines
- Focus on evidence and experience
- Separate person from position
- Acknowledge valid concerns in opposing views
